		<p>The migrate scripts are the building blocks of <code>commandbox-migrations</code>. With them you are defining the schema for your database. These scripts are applied by <code>migrate up</code> and rolled back with <code>migrate down</code>.</p>

		<p>When you call <code>migrate up</code> the <code>up()</code> method in all your scripts are run. Also the <code>cfmigrations</code> table that was created by the <code>migrate install</code> will be populated with a record of which and when each script was executed. This allows <code>commandbox-migrations</code> to keep a track of what scripts to run when <code>migrate up</code> and <code>migrate down</code> are called.</p>

		<p>By calling <code>migrate up</code> the table and the columns defined are created. Check it out! Then calling <code>migrate down</code> will delete or drop the table and all it's records.</p>
